Classics Citrusy Fruity
Harry Yee invented the Tropical Itch cocktail in the late 1950s while he was running the bar at the Hawaiian Village Hotel on Honolulu’s Waikiki Beach. The original recipe called for bourbon, rums, passion fruit, Curaçao and Angostura bitters. At Tern Club in Knoxville, Jocelyn Morin and Ryan Shanley have resurrected the drink and dried it out. Rye stands in for bourbon, allspice dram replaces Curaçao, and lemon and pineapple add extra layers of flavor. The traditional back scratcher garnish from Yee’s original remains, catching the eye of many a curious customer.

Citrusy Fruity
“Sasha Petraske first introduced me to the Star Daisy at the OG Milk & Honey, and I’ve been captivated by it ever since,” says New York’s Joaquín Simó of the lesser-known classic that dates back to at least the early 20th century. With bright citrus and autumnal apple brandy, the unsung cocktail is well-suited to drinking all year round. In Simó’s take on the drink, he adds a bit of extra sugar, finding that orange liqueur needs a bit of “fattening up” to achieve the right mouthfeel.

Fizz Fruity Light
This drink comes from Charles H. Baker’s 1939 The Gentleman’s Companion, which traces its roots back to Manila, circa 1920. The drink originally called for pineapple juice, which we’ve replaced with Small Hand Foods’ pineapple gum syrup, which is a mixture of pineapple juice and sugar thickened with gum arabic. We’ve also replaced the heavy cream with orgeat. The key to making a good fizz is to use three or four large ice cubes in your shaker and shake the drink longer than you might think necessary. Fifteen seconds is about right.

The Puritan emerged at the turn of the 20th century as a mixture of gin, French vermouth, yellow Chartreuse and orange bitters. Will Thompson first encountered it when he was working at Drink in Boston and has brought it all the way to his Miami bar, Sunny’s, where it’s featured on a menu of Martini variations. The understated counterpart to its sibling, the Alaska, the Puritan gets herbal, honeyed complexity from the yellow Chartreuse while still remaining firmly in Martini territory.

This is one of the oldest and best cocktail applications of yellow Chartreuse. I here advocate an early recipe that calls for Old Tom gin found in Jacques Straub’s 1914 work Drinks. I find it results in a wonderfully elegant and mellow drink. More commonly, recipes for the Alaska call for London dry gin, which also works well enough.

Adeep cut from The Savoy Cocktail Book, the Yolanda is something of a candied Martini, building off a base of vermouth complemented by smaller proportions of gin and brandy. While Harry Craddock’s original recipe calls for sweet Italian vermouth, Portland, Maine-based bartender LyAnna Sanabria subs in the semi-sweet Comoz Blanc providing a brighter canvas for her spring-friendly rendition. Bimini Coconut Gin, from Maine’s Round Turn Distilling, and Capurro Acholado Pisco are the lighter stand-ins for the London dry gin and Cognac specified in the pages of Savoy.

Fill tin with cubed ice and hard-shake for 8 to 10 seconds.
Double-strain over cubed ice (or one large cube) into a chilled double rocks glass.

Editor's Note
Macadamia Nut Orgeat
500 grams coconut water (good-quality, purple-hued types, preferably Copra or Harmless brand)
150 grams raw macadamia nuts
4 grams kosher salt
white granulated sugar

1. Combine coconut water, raw macadamia nuts and salt into a blender, then pulse three times in brief, 2-second intervals. Do not purée.
2. Pour the blender contents, unstrained, into a shallow, nonreactive container. Cover, then refrigerate to infuse for at least 12 hours.
3. Position the container of a blender on a gram scale and strain the nut milk into the blender using a cheesecloth or Superbag.
4. Add an equal weight in sugar and blend on high until sugar fully dissolves.
5. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. A film of solids may settle and coat the surface of the liquid; it can be skimmed off easily using a spoon, for a clearer result.

Editor's Note
Acid-Adjusted Orange Juice
500 grams (16 ounces) orange juice
16 grams (3 1/4 teaspoons) citric acid
10 grams (scant 2 1/4 teaspoons) malic acid

Combine juice with acids and stir until incorporated.

Beet Shrub Grenadine
Combine two parts beet shrub with one part grenadine by volume.

Beet Shrub
500 grams (16 ounces) beet juice
150 grams (5 1/4 ounces) Champagne vinegar
125 grams (4 ounces) apple cider
50 grams (1 3/4 ounces) white balsamic vinegar
1 shallot, sliced
1/2 head of garlic, halved
2 bay leaves
white sugar (the exact amount will vary; see directions)

Add all the ingredients to a pot, bring up to a boil for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let cool. Strain out the solids, then weigh the resulting brine. Multiply that number by 0.38 to determine how much sugar to add. For example, if your brine weighs 825 grams (about 4 cups by volume), add 313.5 grams (about 1 1/2 cups) of sugar. Stir to dissolve.

Grenadine
500 grams (2 1/2 cups) white sugar
500 grams (16 ounces) pomegranate juice
150 grams (5 ounces) pomegranate molasses
1/2 teaspoon tangerine extract, preferably OliveNation

Add all ingredients to a blender and blend on the highest setting for 2 to 3 minutes to integrate the molasses fully. Let rest overnight to allow the aeration to dissipate. Alternately, whisk together all ingredients thoroughly in a bowl until sugar is dissolved and everything is incorporated.

Originally published in The Savoy Cocktail Book in 1930, the Rolls Royce is essentially a perfect Martini accented with Bénédictine. At Tigre in New York, William Elliott’s version is a top seller, despite being an old-timer on a mostly 1970s-inspired menu. The expected London dry gin and a barrel-aged, apple-based expression together form the base, which is layered with a moscato chinato in place of the two vermouths, plus Bénédictine, saffron liqueur, orange bitters and expressed lemon oil. Elliott revived his somewhat controversial up-rocks presentation for this drink, both for the added dilution and for its aesthetic similarity to a grand old Rolls.

The Universe is a disco-era cocktail invented by Bobby Batugo in 1978. He entered it in the U.S. Bartenders’ Guild competition that year and won. At the time, the Japanese melon liqueur Midori was new to the U.S. Batugo’s original was a shaken drink with Midori, vodka, pistachio liqueur, and pineapple and lime juices. At Sunken Harbor Club, Shannan Lynch accidentally created a drink that bears a striking resemblance to the Universe, but hers uses the bar’s cutting-edge techniques to create a house melon liqueur (adapted from YouTuber Kevin Kos) and acid-adjusted pineapple and orange juices to give the cocktail a brightness that didn’t exist in the original. She also chose to ditch the vodka in favor of white rum and aged aquavit. Store-bought Midori can be used in place of the DIY melon liqueur; the resulting drink will be much sweeter.

Cocktail Bitter Strong
“Ican’t explain what possessed me,” explains New York City bartender Joaquín Simó, “but within five minutes of spirits importer Eric Seed handing me a bottle of Smith & Cross, I had created this drink.” He began with the blueprint for a classic Negroni, wanting to avoid muddying the flavors with too many other ingredients. “It strikes me as strange that the first thought I had when smelling and tasting this funky, estery, hogo-reeking, grilled banana bread, smoking allspice, brute of an overproof Jamaican rum was, ‘How do I work this into a stirred apertivo?’” Simó usually avoids using Carpano Antica in Negronis—he thinks it can be a bit of a bully—but in the case of a Smith & Cross base, he thought it could stand up to the vermouth’s bombastic chocolate and bitter orange notes, while tempering Campari’s bitterness.

Like all good stories should, the one about the Negroni’s origin involves rakish Italian nobility. Most accounts credit the recipe to one Count Negroni, a swashbuckling proto-boho who reportedly spent time as a rodeo cowboy in the United States. Compounding his wild ways, legend has it that back at a bar in Italy in 1919, he asked for a something like an Americano, but boozier. Swap gin for soda water, and presto, the Negroni. This version, adapted from London bartender Wayne Collins’ riff, turns the original on its head substituting floral Lillet for sweet vermouth and gentian-based Suze for the bitter twinge of Campari.

This version switches traditional sweet vermouth for Dolin Blanc, a sweet white vermouth, and instead of the bitter twang of Campari, Maloney uses a gentian apéritif wine and grapefruit bitters.
