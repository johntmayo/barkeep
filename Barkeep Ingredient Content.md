# Gin

London Dry Gin  
Crisp, juniper-forward classic gin style with no added sweeteners after distillation.  
Its dry, botanical profile makes it the versatile base for staples like the Martini and Gin & Tonic.

Old Tom Gin  
A lightly sweetened 18th-century gin style, softer and less juniper-intense than London Dry.  
Bridging malty genever and dry gin, it’s ideal for historic cocktails like the Tom Collins that benefit from its subtle sweetness.

Plymouth Gin  
A historic style from Plymouth, England, known for a balanced, earthy botanical mix and a slightly softer juniper profile.  
Smoother and more citrus-forward than a London Dry, it works well in martinis and adds a rounded character to any gin cocktail.

Genever  
The Dutch predecessor to modern gin, distilled from a malted grain mash with juniper and other botanicals.  
It has a fuller, malty body with a touch of sweetness, often enjoyed neat or in classic cocktails where its whiskey-like richness shines.

Navy Strength Gin  
Overproof gin (around 57% ABV) originally made for British naval officers, packing intense botanical concentration.  
Its higher alcohol amplifies bold juniper and spice flavors, holding up in punchy cocktails and adding a robust kick to classics.

Sloe Gin  
A ruby-red liqueur made by infusing gin with sloe berries (wild plums) and sugar, yielding tart berry and almond notes.  
Lower in alcohol and sweet-tart in flavor, it’s used as a fruity modifier in drinks like the Sloe Gin Fizz for a crimson twist.

Contemporary Gin  
Modern gin styles that de-emphasize juniper, showcasing citrus, floral, or herbal botanicals more prominently.  
These “New Western” gins offer unique flavor profiles, lending creative twists to cocktails and appealing to those less fond of the traditional juniper punch.

Barrel-Aged Gin  
Gin that’s rested in wood casks, picking up a touch of color and whiskey-like complexity from the oak.  
The aging smooths the gin’s edges and imparts vanilla or spice notes, creating a hybrid spirit great for sipping or adding depth to classic gin cocktails like the Negroni.

# Whiskey

Bourbon  
An American whiskey made primarily from corn (at least 51%) and aged in new charred oak barrels.  
It delivers rich caramel, vanilla, and charred oak flavors with a smooth sweetness, forming the backbone of classics like the Old Fashioned and Mint Julep.

Rye Whiskey  
Whiskey with a majority of rye grain, known for a drier, spicier character of pepper and baking spice.  
Its bold, spicy bite cuts through the sweetness and bitters in cocktails like the Manhattan or Sazerac, keeping these classics crisp and balanced.

Blended Scotch  
A mix of malt and grain whiskies from Scotland combined for a smooth, consistent profile (often with just a whisper of smoke).  
Lighter-bodied than most single malts, it’s versatile for sipping neat or mixing into highballs and other Scotch-based drinks.

Islay Scotch  
Single malt whisky from Scotland’s Islay region, famous for intense peat smoke, sea-spray brine, and medicinal notes.  
Bold and smoky, it’s cherished by peat lovers as a sipper and used sparingly in cocktails like the Penicillin to add a dramatic smoky depth.

Single Malt Scotch  
Whisky made at one Scottish distillery from 100% malted barley, often showcasing that distillery’s unique character.  
Typically complex and smooth (ranging from fruity and floral to heavily peated), it’s prized for sipping or for adding refined depth to spirit-forward cocktails like a Rob Roy.

Irish Whiskey  
Easy-drinking whiskey from Ireland, usually triple-distilled for smoothness and often a blend of malt and grain.  
Light, mellow, and gently fruity with hints of honey and oak, it’s approachable neat or on ice and adds a soft touch to drinks like the Irish Coffee.

Canadian Whisky  
Blended whisky from Canada often made with corn and a touch of rye, famed for its ultra-smooth, light character.  
With subtle sweetness and gentle spice, it’s an all-purpose mixer for highballs and cocktails, and an easygoing sip on its own.

Japanese Whisky  
Refined whisky crafted in Japan, inspired by Scotch tradition but perfected with Japanese precision.  
Typically silky and balanced with delicate smoke or sherry-cask notes, it’s highly sippable neat and elevates simple cocktails like the Whisky Highball with its elegance.

Tennessee Whiskey  
A bourbon-style whiskey from Tennessee that undergoes charcoal mellowing (Lincoln County Process) before barreling.  
It shares bourbon’s corn-rich sweetness and vanilla oak smoothness, with a touch of charcoal depth (as exemplified by Jack Daniel’s), making it great in classic American whiskey cocktails.

American Single Malt  
A growing category of U.S. whiskey made from 100% malted barley at one distillery (much like a Scotch single malt).  
It marries rich malty depth with American innovation, yielding flavors from chocolate and caramel to smoky oak, enjoyed neat or in upscale whiskey cocktails.

Blended Malt Scotch  
A Scotch whisky composed only of single malts from multiple distilleries (no grain whisky), also called a “vatted malt.”  
It offers a harmonized all-malt flavor—complex yet rounded—and is often enjoyed like a single malt or used to add depth in a cocktail without introducing grain spirits.

Highland Single Malt Scotch  
Single malt whisky from Scotland’s Highland region, generally robust and malty with notes of heather, spice, and fruit.  
This broad category ranges from delicate to full-bodied, but typically delivers a warm, rounded profile that’s versatile for sipping or mixing into spirit-forward cocktails.

Speyside Single Malt Scotch  
Single malts from Speyside, Scotland’s most prolific whisky region, known for smooth and elegant profiles.  
Often honeyed and fruity with hints of vanilla or sherry sweetness and minimal smoke, they are crowd-pleasing sippers that also lend gentle complexity to spirit-forward cocktails.

Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey  
A whiskey-based liqueur infused with sweet and fiery cinnamon flavor, bottled at a low 33% ABV.  
More of a party shooter than a craft cocktail ingredient, its candy-like spice can add a fun kick to simple mixed drinks or seasonal punches when used in moderation.

# Rum

White Rum  
Clear, light-bodied rum that is typically unaged (or briefly aged and filtered) for a clean taste.  
With a subtle cane sweetness and a hint of vanilla, it’s the backbone of tropical cocktails like the Daiquiri and Mojito, providing alcohol without heavy flavor. 

Gold Rum  
Light amber rum that’s usually aged a short time (or has a hint of caramel added) to develop a mild golden color and flavor.  
Smoother and more flavorful than white rum, it brings gentle notes of vanilla and caramel, making it a go-to for mixed drinks like a Mai Tai or Rum Punch where extra depth is desired.

Dark Rum  
Deep-colored rum often aged longer or with added molasses/caramel for color and intensity, yielding rich notes of molasses, toffee, and spice.  
Full-bodied and robust, it’s used in bold drinks like the Dark ’n Stormy or floated on tropical cocktails to add weighty sweetness and complexity.

Aged Rum  
Rum matured for several years in oak barrels, developing complexity akin to a fine whiskey.  
Expect smooth notes of oak, vanilla, and dried fruit; premium aged rums are great for sipping neat or elevating classic rum cocktails (like a Rum Old Fashioned) with their depth.

Overproof Rum  
Potent rum bottled at higher-than-normal strength (often 50–75% ABV), far stronger than standard 40% rums.  
It packs a boozy punch and concentrated flavor, so it’s used sparingly in Tiki drinks like the Zombie or as a float/garnish, adding fiery intensity beyond what normal rum provides.

Jamaican Rum  
Pot-still rum from Jamaica famous for its heavy “funk” (high esters) that gives off overripe banana, pineapple, and other intensely funky aromas.  
This intensely flavorful style (a little goes a long way) adds exotic depth to tropical cocktails and is the cornerstone of many Tiki recipes like Planter’s Punch.

Demerara Rum  
Rum from Guyana’s Demerara region, known for a dark, smoky-sweet profile with notes of burnt sugar, toffee, and wood spice.  
Heavy-bodied and rich (e.g., El Dorado rums), it provides a lush, caramelized backbone to tropical libations and stands up well in full-flavored cocktails.

Rhum Agricole  
French Caribbean rum distilled from fresh sugarcane juice (not molasses), typically from Martinique.  
It has a grassy, earthy brightness with vegetal and floral hints—a vibrant departure from molasses rums that shines in cocktails like the Ti’ Punch or a distinctive Daiquiri.

Cachaça  
Brazil’s national spirit, also made from fresh sugarcane juice, with a rustic, earthy edge.  
Generally unaged or lightly aged, it has grassy and fruity notes with a funkier bite than most rum, and is the essential base for a Caipirinha (Brazil’s signature cocktail).

Cuban-Style White Rum  
A smooth, light-bodied rum in the Cuban tradition (think Havana Club or Bacardi), often column-distilled and charcoal-filtered.  
Clean in taste with subtle hints of cane and citrus, it’s perfect for Cuban classics like the Daiquiri and Mojito where a delicate rum lets other flavors shine.

Barbados Rum  
Balanced rum from Barbados, typically a blend of pot and column still distillates aged without heavy additives.  
Renowned for a mellow harmony of vanilla, toasted sugar, and tropical fruit notes, it’s versatile—smooth enough to sip straight and flavorful enough to uplift any rum cocktail.

Demerara Overproof Rum  
A high-proof rum from Guyana combining Demerara’s signature smoky, toffee-rich flavor with intense strength (often \~151 proof).  
It’s an essential component in powerful Tiki drinks, delivering deep caramel smoke and an extra kick, though used sparingly due to its potency.

Rhum Agricole Blanc  
Unaged white rum distilled from fresh sugarcane juice and bottled straight off the still, keeping its full grassy, pungent character intact.  
Bursting with herbal and tropical fruit notes, it’s traditional in the Ti’ Punch and adds an unmistakable earthy kick to cocktails calling for raw sugarcane spirit.

Rhum Agricole Vieux  
Aged rhum agricole (“vieux” meaning old) mellowed in oak barrels for years, which tames its grassy bite and adds vanilla, spice, and woody notes.  
The result is a refined spirit blending earthy cane character with Cognac-like smoothness, excellent for sipping or adding layered complexity to premium cocktails.

Blackstrap Rum  
An extremely dark, heavy rum made from the final molasses (blackstrap) of sugar refining, loaded with deep molasses and licorice flavors.  
Thick and a bit bitter-sweet, it’s usually used in small doses in cocktails to impart rich color and a robust treacle-like sweetness (for example, as a float in Tiki drinks).

Spiced Rum  
Rum infused with spices (vanilla, cinnamon, clove, etc.) and often a hint of added sweetness.  
Its warming spice and smooth sweetness make it popular for mixing with cola, ginger beer, or in easy tropical drinks, though it’s rarely called for in classic cocktails.
